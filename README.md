# Building-a-State-of-Art-Click-Through-Rate-Prediction-Model

## Research Objectives 
- Completing a detailed examination of the studies on CTR prediction and then reporting the 
results.
- Detailed examination of the data sets to be used in the experiment with an exploratory approach, 
then making the necessary pre-processing and more preparing for model testing.
- Testing state of art CTR prediction models with prepared datasets and recording their 
performances with AUC and Logloss scores. Then, performing performance analyzes and making 
comparisons on the models 
- Installation of the model to be used in this study and providing a detailed explanation.
- Tuning the model hyperparameters to get the best out of our model performance and efficiency
